6. Implementation Phases: Logical breakdown of development steps
7. Future Enhancements: Potential improvements for later iterations

## Content Guidelines

1. Be concise and use domain-specific language
2. Provide system context and user impact
3. Describe technical details at an appropriate level
4. Highlight dependencies and edge cases
